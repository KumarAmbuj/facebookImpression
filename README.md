3.Create react app

Documenting the steps for creating a React app for a college project is a great idea! Here's a concise breakdown:

3.1 Setup Environment: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.


3.2 Create React App: Use the command-line interface (CLI) to create a new React app. Run npx create-react-app my-app (replace "my-app" with your preferred app name).


3.3 Navigate to Project: Move into the project directory by running cd my-app.


3.4 Start Development Server: Launch the development server by running npm start. This will open your React app in a browser window.


3.5 Explore File Structure: Familiarize yourself with the file structure, including the src folder where your React components and assets reside.


3.6 Edit Components: Open src/App.js and start editing the default React component. Add new components, styles, or functionality as needed.


3.7 Run Tests (Optional): Run any included tests using npm test to ensure your app's functionality remains intact.


3.8 Build Production Version: When ready to deploy, build a production-ready version of your app using npm run build. This creates an optimized bundle of your app's code.


3.9 Deployment: Deploy your React app to a hosting service or platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.


Documentation: Document the process, including any challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned. Provide screenshots and code snippets to illustrate key points.

5.Using facebook Apis and validating 

5.1 Facebook Graph API:

The Graph API allows you to read and write data to and from Facebook's social graph. It provides access to various endpoints for retrieving information about users, pages, posts, etc.
You can use the Graph API to retrieve basic insights about a post, such as the number of likes, comments, shares, and reactions.
Endpoint example: /{user_is}/posts

5.2 Facebook Marketing API:

The Marketing API is designed for businesses and advertisers to manage their Facebook ad campaigns programmatically.
It provides access to more advanced insights and analytics for posts that are part of advertising campaigns.
With the Marketing API, you can access detailed performance metrics, target specific audiences, and optimize ad campaigns.
Endpoint example: /v19.0/{ad-account-id}/insights

5.3 Facebook Insights API:

The Insights API provides access to aggregated and anonymized data about user activity on a Facebook page or app.
It offers insights into page performance, audience demographics, engagement metrics, and more.
You can use the Insights API to retrieve detailed analytics for posts published on a Facebook page.
Endpoint example: /v19.0/{post-id}/insights













6.Getting Api data and implementing in react app.

To fetch post data from the Facebook Graph API and implement it in a React app using the map method, you can follow these steps:

6.1 Fetch Post Data from API:

Use a library like fetch to fetch post data from the Facebook Graph API.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access token to fetch post data.

6.2 Set State with Post Data:

Once you fetch the post data, set it in the component's state using useState.

6.3 Render Post Data in React Component:

Use the map method to iterate over the array of posts in the state and render each post in your React component.



7.Getting details of single post .


7.1 Get Access Token:

Acquire a user access token with the necessary permissions to read post details, comments, and reactions. You may need the read_insights, read_page_content, or other related permissions.

7.2 Fetch Post Details:

Make a GET request to the Graph API endpoint for the specific post to retrieve its details, including its ID.
Endpoint example: /{post-id}
Replace {post-id} with the ID of the post you want to retrieve details for.

7.3 Fetch Comments:

Make another GET request to the Graph API endpoint for comments on the post to retrieve comment details.
Endpoint example: /{post-id}/comments
Replace {post-id} with the ID of the post.

7.4 Fetch Reactions:

Make a GET request to the Graph API endpoint for reactions on the post to retrieve reaction details.
Endpoint example: /{post-id}/reactions
Replace {post-id} with the ID of the post.

7.5 Process Data:

Process the data received from the API requests as needed.
You may need to parse the JSON response and extract relevant information such as comment text, commenter details, reaction types, etc.
